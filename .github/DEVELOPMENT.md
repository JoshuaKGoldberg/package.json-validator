# Development

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ < your-name-here > /package.json-validator
cd package.json-validator
pnpm install
```

> This repository includes a list of suggested VS Code extensions.
> It's a good idea to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and accept its suggestion to install them, as they'll help with development.

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format code.
It should be applied automatically when you save files in VS Code or make a Git commit.

To manually reformat all files, you can run:

```shell
pnpm format --write
```

## Linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is used to lint JavaScript source files.
You can run it locally on the command-line:

```shell
pnpm run lint
```

ESLint can be run with `--fix` to auto-fix some lint rule complaints:

```shell
pnpm run lint --fix
```

Note that you'll likely need to run `pnpm build` before `pnpm lint` so that lint rules which check the file system can pick up on any built files.
