# About
package.json files are central for node.js/npm projects. Beyond just valid json, there are required fields to follow the Packages [1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0)/[1.1](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0) specifications.

This tool verifies the package.json against the spec, letting you know about errors that you MUST have, and making recommendations for optional fields that you SHOULD have.

# Future ideas...
* An API
* A node based command line interface, that would allow for plugins for editors
